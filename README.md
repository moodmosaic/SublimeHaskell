This is *my* fork of [SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell][SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell]. â€” Key improvements:

- Syntax for Haskell and Cabal is rewritten (in sync with [sublimehq#2225][sublimehq#2225])
- Syntax for Haskell has its own *dedicated* color scheme (based on Monokai)
- Output pane is removed in favor of built-in gutter icons

---

The ultimate goal is to turn this into a SublimeHaskell-*Lite*; support only [hsdev][hsdev], put everything in a single source file, remove everything except icons.
