This is *my* fork of [SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell][SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell].

Key improvements: 
- Syntax for Haskell and Cabal is rewritten (in sync with [sublimehq#2225][sublimehq#2225])
- Syntax for Haskell has its own *dedicated* color scheme
- Output pane is removed in favor of built-in gutter icons
